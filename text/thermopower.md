With the introduction of a thermal gradient the dynamics of the system change, as measured in the transport property, thermopower, so as to ensure there is no net current. Asserting that the temperature is greatest at the left edge of the system and smallest at the right edge (see slider) we find an instant change in the constant, continuous, current. 

By Fermi-Dirac statistics [(11)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_statistics) the current at the left edge increases relative to the other edges. The system then, to ensure no net current, redistributes the electrons; moving electrons at the left edge to the right edge. This is expressed as decreasing the chemical potential [(12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_potential) at the left edge $ \mu_l $ and increasing the chemical potential at the right edge $ \mu_r $. 

This chemical potential difference may be rephrased as a voltage between the two edges which gives a bulk current, or Hall current, through the system (note the local dervative of the bulk states). The (diffusion) thermopower $ S_{xx} $ is then measured as the ratio of the induced voltage $ \Delta \mathrm{V} $ to the temperature difference between the left and right edges $ \Delta \mathrm{T} $.
