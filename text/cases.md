With the inclusion of capacitive coupling [(13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitive_coupling) between the edges of the Landau levels we can consider 3 different scenarios by which thermopower develops.

- The first denoted by $1$ and $2$ describes complete independence (no capacitive coupling) of the first and second Landau level respectively
- The second denoted by $1,2$ describes minimum capacitive coupling
- The third denoted by $1+2$ descibes maximum capacitive coupling
