The regions of a Landau level which are degenerate consist of 'bulk' states and the non-degenerate regions closer to the edge consist of 'edge' states. These states, without additional interactions, are further differentiated by their drift velocity. The drift velocity of a state is proportional to the gradient of the energy spectrum in its local proximity (within a few characteristic lengths). Hence without additional perturbation the bulk states do not have a drift velocity whereas the edge states do. These edge states are occupied by electrons so a constant current is produced in the Landau level as illustrated by the rings in the diagram of the system.
